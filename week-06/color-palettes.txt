# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: monochromaticPalette_laptop.png
Explanation of your color choices: Started with a base hue of black and then increased the R.G.B values to
attain more grayish/white colors.  Last added a bright color to stand out.  These choices are based off
comparing multiple custom gaming laptop sites and gathering their similarities.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Explanation of your color choices: Chose colors that could resemble or portray and natural/organic feel.  
Colors best fit are bright , high red/green values.  Colors matching this description are red, yellow, orange, 
green, brown.  My choice specifically is base green with more/less shade added.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: complementaryPalette_banking.png
Explanation of your color choices: My choice of colors was to represent a simple and profession design.  
I used white and lighter shades before black to contrast and be the layout/background.  Blue and orange 
contrast aswell, and would be used as the decoration colors to make elements stand out.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename: triadicPalette_games.png
Explanation of your color choices:  Children typically are drawn to colorfull and fun designs.  My palette colors
contain an array of differing colors to create a design full of bold color in order to have a fun look while 
keeping the child's attention.
