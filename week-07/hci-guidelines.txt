# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/
* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/
                          MobileHIG/Navigation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH53-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
    filenames: sketch- (IMG_0449.PNG) , iit - (IMG_0450.PNG)
    explanation: The actual homepage does not incorporate any sort of navigation for the user, instead puts up 
    everything on single page.  The profile after logging in does contain a navbar but it is not very appealing
    nor efficiently designed for mobile users.
    
* HCI Guidline Two (URL): https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/structure.html#
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
    filenames:  iit- (iitHomepageStructure.png) , sketch - (IMG_0451.PNG)
    explanation: The homepage of the current iit homepage is not organised very well and and too much information all
    over the page boxxed/cut into too many individual regions, all making for an ugly/non-user friendly layout.  In my 
    sketch I tried to better organize the structure presented on the desktop view of the homepage by adding a horozontal
    divider, and un-clumping all the information from itself (make important elements priority,  get rid of block of paragraph
    content, use regions for specific information/details).
    
* HCI Guidline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/
                            Conceptual/MobileHIG/Principles.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH4-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
    filenames: iit - (IMG_0447.PNG) , sketch - (IMG_0448.PNG)
    explanation: The actual mobile view of the iit homepage squishes and shrinks all the elements to beable to
    fit on the screen.  In my sketch I tried to implement a design for mobile view that changes the format of
    the page to include important details at the top and not include unneccassary information instead of trying to fit
    everything. This was in order to apply consistancy between multiple devices.
