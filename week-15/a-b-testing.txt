# Production Problem 9: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on some website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. 
The improvement should be minor, as we discussed in class.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test.
Finally, describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`week-15`)
  desktop: interfaceDesktop.png    ;     phone: interfacePhone.png
  
* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`week-15`)
  sketch: interfaceDrawing.jpg
  
* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for
the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)
  Modification: The interface chosen is the slider on videos for the website.  Currently, it is very difficult to use whether to
  go backword or forward especially on smaller devices such as a phone.  In order to try proving and improvement of experience,
  I'd add a circle tool to use in assisting navigation throughout the slider placed on the current timeslot the video is at.
  
  HTML: The HTML will just hold the skeleton for the current version of the video.  There will also be a div holding what will be a progress bar overlay for the video but this div will be hidden unless triggered.
  
  CSS:
  
  JS:  The javascipt's function for this test will be to have a function with a random algorithm generated to pick whether a 
  user will have a video with or without the assistance of the circle tool on slider.
